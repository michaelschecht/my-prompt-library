**Note:** Replace all [bracketed placeholders] with your specific content. Remember to:
- Use lowercase with hyphens for the agent name (e.g., `git-workflow-manager`)
- Include 2-3 concrete examples in the description field with context, user query, assistant response, and commentary
- List all tools the agent needs (Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Glob, Grep, Browser, etc.)
- Specify the recommended model (haiku for fast/simple, sonnet for balanced, opus for complex)
- Structure sections logically with clear domain areas
- Include JSON protocol examples for agent communication
- Provide progress tracking formats
- Document integration points with other agents
- Keep best practices and patterns concrete and actionable
