## 2026-04-29 — My Library, Skill Packs & search

**My Library actions**
- Added explicit **Remove from My Library** controls in card/detail views; clarified delete labels.

**Prompt add/copy**
- Fixed post-add refresh that could blank the list until reload; unified on a lightweight fetch with safer response handling.

**Skill Packs — public vs my library**
- Skill Packs now respect `library=public|my` in frontend and backend.
- New install-tracking table `user_skill_pack_installs`; My Library shows only packs the user added, Public shows the full catalog.
- Explicit add/remove lifecycle with confirm dialogs:
  - `POST /api/skill-packs/:packId/add-to-library`
  - `DELETE /api/skill-packs/:packId/remove-from-library`
- Imported skills tagged `skill-pack:<packId>` so removal cleans up every skill from that pack.

**Prompt creation**
- Create-Prompt section dropdown matches the app taxonomy (`1_Guides`…`5_System_Prompts`); new prompts force My Library mode; default section `4_Prompts`.

**Search**
- Ranking prioritizes title matches: starts-with → contains → other (tags/category/content).

_Touched: `src/App.tsx`, `PromptEditorModal.tsx`, `SkillPacksView.tsx`, `routes/skill-packs.ts`, `api/skill-packs.ts`, `db/postgres.ts`, `api/prompt-index.json`._

## 2026-03-25 — Performance pass + content expansion

**Performance** (the library had grown to ~1,400 files and was freezing cold starts and the browser)
- **Prebuilt prompt index** (`scripts/build-prompt-index.js` → `api/prompt-index.json`): metadata + 200-char previews generated at build time. Cold start **2–5s → <100ms**.
- **Lightweight mode** (`?lightweight=true`): preview-only payloads, full content lazy-loaded. Initial payload **13MB → 278KB**.
- **`GET /api/prompts/:id`**: fetch a single prompt with full content (file-based or DB).
- **Pagination** at 50/page: DOM elements **1,427 → 50**, memory ~200MB → ~20MB. Resets to page 1 on filter change. (Adjustable in `src/App.tsx`.)
- **File-size filter**: skip files >500KB during index build (excludes two multi-MB bulk collections).
- **5-minute in-memory cache** for public-library lightweight requests.

**Content**
- 7 new MCP-server prompt collections (~135 prompts): GitHub, Playwright, Serper, Google Workspace, n8n, Supabase, Firebase.
- Featured prompts refreshed toward developer roles (21 total); contextual emojis added.

**Fixes / maintenance**
- Converted new MCP files from comma-string tags to YAML arrays (fixed `tags.forEach is not a function`).
- Added missing `#` headings to 3 `SKILL.md` files.
- Renamed `Mcp_Servers/` → `MCP_Servers/` for consistent acronym casing.

> Folder names above (`Prompt_Library/…`) reflect the pre-rename layout; the library has
> since moved to the numbered `1_Guides`…`5_System_Prompts` scheme.
