## How to Add a New Pack

### Step 1: Create Pack Manifest

Create a new JSON file in `library/Skills/packs/`:

```bash
cd library/Skills/packs
touch my-new-pack.json
```

### Step 2: Define Pack Structure

```json
{
  "name": "My New Pack",
  "id": "my-new-pack",
  "description": "A collection of skills for...",
  "icon": "🚀",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "author": "my-prompt-library",
  "tags": ["tag1", "tag2"],
  "category": "Development",
  "skills": [],
  "prerequisites": {
    "required_tools": [],
    "optional_tools": [],
    "recommended_knowledge": []
  },
  "installation_notes": "Setup instructions here...",
  "use_cases": [
    "Use case 1"
  ],
  "related_packs": [],
  "created_at": "2026-03-28",
  "updated_at": "2026-03-28"
}
```

### Step 3: Add Skills

Find skills to include:

```bash
# List all available skills
find library/Skills -name "SKILL.md" -type f
```

Add each skill to the `skills` array:

```json
{
  "path": "library/Skills/Git/gh-address-comments/SKILL.md",
  "name": "GitHub PR Comment Handler",
  "description": "Address review comments on GitHub PRs"
}
```

**Important:** Use relative paths from the repo root.

### Step 4: Test Locally

```bash
# Start dev server
npm run dev

# Visit http://localhost:3010
# Navigate to Skill Packs tab
# Your new pack should appear
```

### Step 5: Commit and Deploy

```bash
git add library/Skills/packs/my-new-pack.json
git commit -m "Add My New Pack skill pack"
git push origin main
```

Vercel will automatically deploy your new pack.

## How to Modify an Existing Pack

### Update Pack Metadata

Edit the JSON file directly:

```bash
# Open pack file
nano library/Skills/packs/developer-essentials-pack.json
```

Common updates:
- Change description
- Update version number
- Add/remove tags
- Update installation notes

### Add Skills to Pack

1. Find the skill path:
```bash
find library/Skills -name "SKILL.md" | grep "skill-name"
```

2. Add to `skills` array:
```json
{
  "path": "library/Skills/Category/new-skill/SKILL.md",
  "name": "New Skill Name",
  "description": "What it does"
}
```

3. Increment version:
```json
"version": "1.1.0",
"updated_at": "2026-03-28"
```

### Remove Skills from Pack

1. Remove skill entry from `skills` array
2. Decrement `skillCount` is auto-calculated, so no manual update needed
3. Update version and date

### Update Prerequisites

Modify the `prerequisites` object:

```json
"prerequisites": {
  "required_tools": ["git", "node", "docker"],
  "optional_tools": ["kubernetes"],
  "recommended_knowledge": ["JavaScript", "Linux basics"]
}
```
