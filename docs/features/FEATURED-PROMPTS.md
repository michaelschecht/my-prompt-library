## How to Feature a Prompt

### Method: Tag-Based (Current Implementation)
Add `"featured"` to the tags array in prompt frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: "🎯 Your Prompt Title"
tags: ["featured", "other-tag", "category"]
category: "Category"
subcategory: "Subcategory"
---
```

### Emoji Guidelines
All featured prompts should have an emoji in the title for better visual identification:

**Common Emojis by Category:**
- Business/Finance: 💼 📊 💰 ₿ 📈
- Developer/Tech: 👨‍💻 💻 ⚙️ 🎨 📊 🔧
- Writing/Content: ✍️ 📝 📄 📚
- AI/Models: 🧠 🤖 ✨ 🚀
- MCP Servers: 🚀 🎭 🔍 📧 🔄 🗄️ 🔥
- Guides/Skills: 📖 🛠️ 💻 ⌨️

---

## Featured Prompts Display Logic

**Code Location:** `src/App.tsx`

**Display on Landing Page:**
- Shows 4 featured prompts per section when no search/filter is active
- Grid layout: responsive (1 col mobile → 4 cols desktop)
- Special styling: Star badge, accent border, hover glow

**Filtering:**
```typescript
const featuredPrompts = useMemo(() => {
  return sortedPrompts
    .filter(p => p.tags?.includes('featured'))
    .slice(0, 4);
}, [sortedPrompts]);
```

**Pagination:**
- Featured prompts appear on page 1 by default
- Total results are paginated at 50 prompts per page
- Navigation controls: Previous/Next with page indicators

---

## Best Practices

### Selection Criteria
- ✅ **High Quality**: Well-written, comprehensive, useful
- ✅ **Representative**: Shows variety across categories
- ✅ **Includes Emoji**: Title has appropriate emoji
- ✅ **Up-to-Date**: Recently created or reviewed
- ✅ **Diverse**: Mix of categories and use cases
- ✅ **Collections**: MCP server collections should include 10+ examples

### Emoji Selection
- Choose emojis that represent the content/category
- Keep consistent within categories
- Use common, recognizable emojis
- Avoid complex or obscure emojis

### Display Balance
- Maintain 4-6 featured prompts per major section
- Rotate seasonally or when new high-quality content added
- Keep at least 2-3 "evergreen" featured prompts
- Feature new collections to drive discovery

---

## Performance Considerations

**Index Pre-building:**
- Featured prompts are included in the prebuilt prompt index
- Index regenerates on each deployment
- Reduces cold start time from 2-5s to <100ms

**Pagination Impact:**
- Featured prompts load with first page (50 items)
- No performance penalty for featured status
- Index includes 200-char content preview

---

## Notes

- Featured prompts appear on **landing page only** (not in search/filtered views)
- The app limits display to **4 featured prompts** per view
- Featured status does NOT affect search or filtering functionality
- All featured prompts should include emojis in titles
- Large prompt collections (10+ prompts) are preferred for MCP servers
