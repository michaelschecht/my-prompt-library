# Thumbnail Designer Concepts

<!-- Analyzes a podcast episode summary to generate high-converting YouTube thumbnail concepts and text. -->

---

## Metadata

- **Category:** Video
- **Subcategory:** Podcasts
- **Complexity:** Simple
- **Use Case:** Generating ideas and copy for eye-catching video podcast thumbnails
- **Version:** 1.0
- **Last Updated:** 2024-05-23

## Purpose

A great podcast script needs an audience to hear it. This prompt analyzes the core topic or the most engaging hook of your script to generate high-converting visual concepts and short, punchy text for a YouTube or Spotify thumbnail.

---

## Input Requirements

**Required:**
- [PODCAST_SUMMARY_OR_HOOK]: A brief summary of the episode, or the main hook/revelation.

**Optional:**
- [PODCAST_BRAND_COLORS]: Brand colors to incorporate.
- [GUEST_NAME]: Name of the guest (if applicable) to feature.

---

## Prompt

```
You are an expert YouTube strategist and graphic designer specializing in high Click-Through-Rate (CTR) thumbnails for video podcasts.

I have an upcoming podcast episode and I need 3 distinct thumbnail concepts.

Here is the core topic/hook of the episode:
[PODCAST_SUMMARY_OR_HOOK]

Brand Colors (Optional): [PODCAST_BRAND_COLORS]
Guest (Optional): [GUEST_NAME]

For each of the 3 thumbnail concepts, provide:
1. **The Visual Concept:** Describe the imagery, the layout, and the facial expressions of the host/guest (e.g., "Split screen, host looking shocked on the left, an exploding chart on the right").
2. **Thumbnail Text:** Extremely short, punchy text to go *on* the image (Max 4 words. It should NOT be the title of the video, but rather a hook that complements the title).
3. **AI Image Prompt (Optional):** A prompt that could be fed into Midjourney to generate the background or core visual element of the thumbnail.

Ensure the concepts are eye-catching, evoke curiosity or emotion, and follow best practices for YouTube thumbnails.
```

## Expected Output

Three distinct visual concepts for a podcast thumbnail, including layout descriptions, copy, and optional AI generation prompts.

**Format:**
- List of 3 concepts

**Key components to include:**
- Visual Layout/Concept
- Short Thumbnail Text
- Background generation prompt

**Example structure:**
- **Concept 1: The Shocking Reveal**
- **Concept 2: The Data Driven**
- **Concept 3: The Personal Story**

---

## Example Usage

### Input
```
[PODCAST_SUMMARY_OR_HOOK]: We discuss how AI is going to replace 40% of middle management jobs in the next 5 years, but why that might actually be a good thing for workers.
[PODCAST_BRAND_COLORS]: Neon Blue and Black
[GUEST_NAME]:
```

### Output
```
### Thumbnail Concepts

**Concept 1: The Warning**
- **Visual Concept:** A close-up of the host looking intensely at the camera with a serious expression. In the background, a glowing, neon blue robot hand is pressing a button labeled "FIRE".
- **Thumbnail Text:** "YOU'RE NEXT."
- **AI Image Prompt:** A glowing neon blue robotic hand pressing a large red button on a black desk, cinematic lighting, high contrast, shallow depth of field.

**Concept 2: The Data**
- **Visual Concept:** The host on the right side pointing to the left. On the left, a massive, imposing graph plummets downwards in neon blue.
- **Thumbnail Text:** "40% GONE."
- **AI Image Prompt:** A dramatic 3D bar chart crashing downwards, neon blue lines on a pure black background, corporate destruction concept, glowing elements.
```

## Tips & Best Practices

- **Tip 1:** Thumbnail text should never just repeat the video title. It should create a curiosity gap that makes the viewer *want* to read the title and click.
- **Tip 2:** Keep the concepts simple. Thumbnails are viewed on tiny mobile screens; overly complex imagery will get lost.
- **Tip 3:** High contrast and visible human emotion (faces) generally perform best for video podcasts.

## Notes

While this prompt can generate the *background* imagery via an AI prompt, a human designer will still need to composite the host's face and the typography in a tool like Photoshop or Canva for best results.
