# API Developer Welcome Series

## Purpose
Create a highly technical, value-driven email welcome sequence for developers who have just signed up for an API key or developer portal account. The goal is to drive "Time to First Hello World" (TTFHW) and successful integration.

## Instructions
Act as a Developer Advocate or Technical Product Marketing Manager. Write a 3-part email sequence designed specifically for software engineers. Developers hate marketing fluff; these emails must be concise, provide immediate technical value, link directly to documentation/code snippets, and offer clear paths for technical support.

Specify the type of API (e.g., payment gateway, SMS/communications, machine learning models), the primary programming languages supported, and the ultimate goal (e.g., making the first API call, moving from sandbox to production).

## Output Format
Structure the developer onboarding sequence as follows:
1. **Developer Persona & Goal**: Define the target developer and the primary technical milestone.
2. **Email 1: Your API Keys & Quickstart (Day 0)**: Immediate delivery of credentials and the fastest path to a successful test request.
3. **Email 2: SDKs, Libraries, & Best Practices (Day 2)**: Highlighting tools that make integration easier and addressing common rate-limiting or authentication errors.
4. **Email 3: Sandbox to Production & Support (Day 5)**: The checklist for going live and introducing the developer community/support channels (e.g., Discord, GitHub, StackOverflow).

## Example
**Input:**
API Type: Geocoding and Mapping API.
Supported Languages: Node.js, Python, cURL.
Goal: Making the first authenticated API request to return a set of coordinates.

**Output:**
### 1. Developer Persona & Goal
**Persona:** Backend developers building location-based services.
**Goal:** Time to First Hello World (TTFHW) under 5 minutes.

### Email 1: Your API Keys & Quickstart (Day 0)
**Subject:** Welcome to [API Name] - Here are your keys
**Body:**
Hey [Name],
Thanks for signing up for [API Name]. Your sandbox environment is ready.

Here is your Sandbox API Key: `[Insert Key Here]`

**Get started in 60 seconds:**
You can make your first request right now using cURL:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.example.com/v1/geocode?address=1600+Amphitheatre+Parkway" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

Happy coding,
The [API Name] Engineering Team
