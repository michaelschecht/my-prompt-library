# Windows Performance Optimizer

## Purpose
Create a comprehensive PowerShell script to optimize Windows system performance by adjusting system settings, disabling unnecessary services, and improving resource allocation.

## Instructions

Generate a PowerShell script that performs the following optimization tasks:

### System Performance
1. **Disable Visual Effects** for better performance
2. **Adjust Power Plan** to High Performance mode
3. **Disable Windows Search Indexing** for specific drives (optional)
4. **Optimize Paging File** settings
5. **Disable SuperFetch/Prefetch** if using SSD

### Services Optimization
1. Identify and **disable unnecessary Windows services**:
   - Xbox services (if not gaming)
   - Windows Telemetry services
   - Print Spooler (if no printer)
   - Bluetooth services (if not using)
2. Set remaining services to **Manual** where appropriate

### Network Optimization
1. **Disable network throttling**
2. **Optimize TCP/IP settings**
3. **Clear DNS cache**
4. **Reset network stack** if needed

### Registry Tweaks
1. Disable **Windows animations**
2. Speed up **menu show delay**
3. Optimize **processor scheduling**
4. Disable **automatic maintenance**

### Safety Features
- **Create system restore point** before making changes
- **Log all changes** to a file with timestamps
- Include **rollback capability** for each optimization
- **Admin rights check** at script start

## Output Format

```powershell
# ============================================
# Windows Performance Optimizer Script
# Created: [Date]
# Version: 1.0
# Requires: Administrator privileges
# ============================================

# Check for admin rights
if (-NOT ([Security.Principal.WindowsPrincipal][Security.Principal.WindowsIdentity]::GetCurrent()).IsInRole([Security.Principal.WindowsBuiltInRole] "Administrator")) {
    Write-Warning "Please run this script as Administrator!"
    Break
}

# Create restore point
Write-Host "Creating system restore point..." -ForegroundColor Yellow
Checkpoint-Computer -Description "Before Performance Optimization" -RestorePointType "MODIFY_SETTINGS"

# [Rest of optimization code...]

# Log file path
$logPath = "$env:USERPROFILE\Desktop\optimization-log.txt"

# Function to log changes
function Write-Log {
    param($message)
    $timestamp = Get-Date -Format "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss"
    "$timestamp - $message" | Out-File -FilePath $logPath -Append
}

# [Include all optimization functions with logging...]
```

## Example Use Case

**Scenario**: User has a Windows 10/11 PC that has become slow over time due to bloatware and unnecessary services.

**Script Actions**:
1. Creates restore point
2. Disables 15+ unnecessary services
3. Optimizes visual effects
4. Adjusts power settings
5. Performs network optimizations
6. Logs all changes to desktop
7. Shows before/after performance metrics

**Expected Outcome**:
- Faster boot time (20-30% improvement)
- More responsive UI
- Better multitasking performance
- Reduced background CPU/RAM usage

## Important Notes

- **Always create a system restore point** before running
- Test on a non-production machine first
- Some optimizations may need to be **reverted for specific use cases** (e.g., printer services if you add a printer later)
- The script should be **idempotent** (safe to run multiple times)
- Include **detailed comments** explaining each optimization

## Advanced Features to Include

1. **Performance benchmarking** before and after
2. **Service dependency checking** before disabling
3. **Interactive mode** with confirmation prompts
4. **Silent mode** for automated deployment
5. **Profile-based optimization** (Gaming, Office Work, Development)
6. **Scheduled task creation** for recurring optimizations
