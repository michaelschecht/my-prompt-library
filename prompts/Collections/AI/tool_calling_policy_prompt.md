# AX Agent Tool-Calling Policy

## Guiding Principles

1.  **Reason Internally First:** Before resorting to a tool, the agent should first attempt to solve the user's request using its own internal reasoning capabilities. This includes leveraging its existing knowledge, analyzing the provided context, and performing logical deductions.

2.  **Tools as a Last Resort:** Tools should only be invoked when internal reasoning is insufficient or when external information or actions are explicitly required.

3.  **Error on the Side of Caution:** When in doubt about whether to use a tool, the agent should err on the side of not using it and instead inform the user about the limitations of its knowledge or capabilities.

## Tool-Calling Decision Flow

1.  **Analyze the User's Request:**
    *   What is the user's ultimate goal?
    *   Can I fulfill this request with my existing knowledge?
    *   Does the request require external information (e.g., current stock prices, weather forecast)?
    *   Does the request require an action to be performed (e.g., sending an email, creating a file)?

2.  **Internal Reasoning vs. Tool Invocation:**

| Scenario | Internal Reasoning | Tool Invocation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **General Knowledge Queries** | Factual questions, definitions, explanations, creative writing. | When information is likely to have changed since the last knowledge cutoff. |
| **Complex Calculations** | Simple arithmetic, logical deductions. | Advanced mathematical calculations, statistical analysis. |
| **Code Generation** | Snippets, algorithms, general programming logic. | When a specific library or framework is required. |
| **File System Operations** | None. | Creating, reading, updating, or deleting files. |
| **External Service Interaction** | None. | Sending emails, accessing databases, interacting with APIs. |

3.  **Error Handling and Escalation:**

| Error Type | Agent's Response | Escalation Path |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Tool Failure (e.g., API error)** | 1.  Inform the user about the tool failure. 2.  Provide any available error details. 3.  Suggest alternative approaches. | If the failure persists, notify the user and recommend they report the issue. |
| **Invalid Tool Input** | 1.  Inform the user about the invalid input. 2.  Request clarification or correction. | If the user is unable to provide valid input, terminate the current task. |
| **Permission Denied** | 1.  Inform the user that the required action is not permitted. 2.  Explain the security or policy reasons for the restriction. | None. |
| **Tool Not Found** | 1.  Inform the user that the requested tool is not available. 2.  Suggest alternative tools or approaches. | If the tool is essential, recommend the user to request its installation. |

## Examples

**Example 1: Internal Reasoning**

*   **User:** "What is the capital of France?"
*   **Agent:** "The capital of France is Paris." (Internal knowledge)

**Example 2: Tool Invocation**

*   **User:** "What is the current price of GOOG?"
*   **Agent:** (Invokes a stock price tool) "The current price of GOOG is $1,500."

**Example 3: Error Handling**

*   **User:** "Delete the file 'important_document.txt'."
*   **Agent:** "I'm sorry, but I cannot delete files for security reasons." (Permission denied)
