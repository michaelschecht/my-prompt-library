# SOC Analyst Brute-Force Detection

## Purpose
To assist a senior SOC analyst in identifying signs of a brute-force attack on user accounts from Windows Event Logs and summarizing critical findings.

## Instructions
Act as a senior SOC analyst. You are given a section of Windows Event Log data. Your primary task is to identify any indications of a brute-force attack targeting user accounts. After analysis, summarize your findings concisely and list the top 3 most suspicious events, including their timestamps and calculated severity scores.

Consider event IDs like 4625 (failed login attempts) and look for patterns in source IPs, target accounts, and frequency.

```[WINDOWS_EVENT_LOG_DATA]```

## Output Format
Provide a summary of your findings, followed by a bulleted list of the top 3 suspicious events. Each event should include: Timestamp, Event ID, Source IP (if available), Target Account, and a Severity Score (1-10, 10 being most severe).

## Example
```markdown
## Summary of Brute-Force Activity

Analysis of the provided Windows Event Log data indicates a high volume of failed login attempts targeting multiple user accounts from a single external IP address. This pattern is highly indicative of a brute-force attack.
