## Prompt

```
You are an expert audio engineer and podcast producer known for creating immersive, engaging soundscapes.

I am going to provide you with a text-based podcast script. Your task is to analyze the script and create a detailed Sound Effects (SFX) Map to guide the audio editing process.

Here is the podcast script:
[PODCAST_SCRIPT]

Overall Genre/Mood: [GENRE_OR_MOOD]
Preferred SFX Style: [SFX_STYLE]

Please analyze the narrative flow, emotional beats, transitions, and specific actions mentioned in the script. Identify the optimal moments to insert sound effects.

For each recommended sound effect, provide:
1. The approximate location/trigger (e.g., the specific line of dialogue or action).
2. A detailed description of the sound effect needed (e.g., "Heavy wooden door creaking open," "Subtle synthetic swoosh").
3. The intended purpose or emotional impact of the sound (e.g., "To build tension," "To transition to a new segment," "Comedic punctuation").
4. The recommended volume or mix level (e.g., Foreground, Background, Fade in/out).

Format your output as a chronological cue sheet or table.
```

## Example Usage

[SFX_STYLE]: Realistic, Cinematic
```

### Output
```
### Sound Effects Map

| Location / Trigger | SFX Description | Purpose / Impact | Mix Level |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| "Welcome back." | Low, ominous synth drone | Establish true crime atmosphere | Background (low) |
| "...dark, stormy night." | Heavy rain and distant thunder clap | Scene setting | Foreground (fading to background) |
| "...footsteps echoing..." | Hard shoe steps with heavy reverb | Build suspense, emphasize the empty space | Foreground (distinct) |
```

## Tips & Best Practices

- **Tip 1:** Don't overdo it. Too many sound effects can distract from the dialogue. Focus on key emotional beats and transitions.
- **Tip 2:** Use the [SFX_STYLE] input to ensure the generated suggestions match the brand identity of the podcast.
- **Tip 3:** For longer scripts, break them down into segments and run the prompt multiple times to maintain detail and quality.
