## Metadata

- **Subcategory:** Podcasts
- **Complexity:** Simple
- **Use Case:** Designing the layout and aesthetic of short promotional audio clips (audiograms) for social media

## Purpose

When sharing audio-only podcasts on visual platforms like Instagram, LinkedIn, or Twitter, creators use "audiograms" (static images or short videos with an animated waveform and captions). This prompt acts as an art director, suggesting visually engaging layouts, typography, and animation styles based on the podcast's topic and target audience.

---

## Input Requirements

**Required:**
- [PODCAST_TOPIC]: The main subject of the podcast.
- [TARGET_PLATFORM]: Where the audiogram will be posted (e.g., Instagram Feed (1:1), TikTok/Reels (9:16), LinkedIn).

**Optional:**
- [BRAND_VIBE]: The overall aesthetic of the brand (e.g., corporate, playful, minimalist, aggressive).
- [HEADLINE_COPY]: The main text you want on the audiogram.

## Prompt

```
You are an expert social media art director specializing in podcast promotion.

I need a design guide for an audiogram (a short video clip featuring an animated audio waveform, captions, and a background image/video) to promote my podcast on social media.

Podcast Topic: [PODCAST_TOPIC]
Target Platform: [TARGET_PLATFORM]
Brand Vibe (Optional): [BRAND_VIBE]
Headline (Optional): [HEADLINE_COPY]

Please provide 3 distinct design concepts for the audiogram. For each concept, detail the following elements:
1. **Layout & Composition:** Where should the headline, waveform, captions, and podcast logo be placed? Provide dimensions (e.g., 1080x1080 for square).
2. **Background Visual:** Should it be a solid color, a subtle looping video, a photo of the host, or abstract art?
3. **Waveform Style:** What type of audio waveform animation fits best? (e.g., thin minimalist lines, thick geometric bars, a circular ring, neon glow).
4. **Typography & Captions:** Recommend font styles for the headline and the dynamic captions (e.g., bold sans-serif, elegant serif, highlighted karaoke-style text).
5. **Color Palette:** Suggest a 3-color palette for the background, text, and waveform.
```

### Audiogram Design Guide

**Concept 1: The 'Direct to Camera' Vibe**
- **Layout & Composition:** 1080x1920 (9:16). Podcast logo small at the top center. Headline `[HEADLINE_COPY]` large in the upper third. Large, dynamic captions taking up the middle. Waveform anchored at the very bottom.
- **Background Visual:** A high-quality, slightly blurred vertical photo of a cozy coffee shop interior or an aesthetic flat-lay of a notebook and latte.
- **Waveform Style:** A thick, continuous, smooth curved line (not bars) that bounces fluidly with the voice.
- **Typography & Captions:** Headline in a bold, friendly sans-serif (like Poppins). Captions in a very legible, modern font, utilizing a "karaoke style" highlight where the current word turns a bright accent color.
- **Color Palette:** Background: Cream/Off-White. Text: Charcoal Grey. Waveform/Highlights: Vibrant Matcha Green.

**Concept 2: The 'Bold Graphic'**
- **Layout & Composition:** 1080x1920 (9:16). Split horizontally 50/50. Top half is a solid color block containing the headline. Bottom half holds the captions and waveform.
- **Background Visual:** No photo. Top half is a bright, solid brand color. Bottom half is dark.
- **Waveform Style:** Thick, blocky, geometric vertical bars reflecting the audio intensity.
- **Typography & Captions:** Headline in an ultra-bold, uppercase font (like Anton or Impact). Captions in a clean sans-serif.
- **Color Palette:** Top Half: Coral Pink. Bottom Half: Deep Navy Blue. Text/Waveform: Pure White.
```

## Tips & Best Practices

- **Tip 1:** Always prioritize the legibility of the captions. If the background is too busy, add a dark semi-transparent overlay behind the text.
- **Tip 2:** Different platforms prefer different formats. Reels/TikTok require vertical (9:16), while LinkedIn and Twitter often perform better with square (1:1) or landscape (16:9).
- **Tip 3:** The waveform should be visually interesting but shouldn't distract from the actual message in the captions.
