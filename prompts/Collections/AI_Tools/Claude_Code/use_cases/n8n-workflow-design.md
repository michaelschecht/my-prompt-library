Design an n8n automation workflow with error handling and pagination.

## Prompt

```
Design an n8n workflow for: [AUTOMATION GOAL]. Describe each node: type, configuration, and what data it passes to the next node. Include error handling branches. Consider rate limits and API pagination. Output as a step-by-step node description ready to implement.
```

## Usage Notes

- Replace `[AUTOMATION GOAL]` with what you want automated
- Each node description includes type, config, and data handoff
- Error handling branches are required, not optional
- Rate limits and pagination details prevent production failures
