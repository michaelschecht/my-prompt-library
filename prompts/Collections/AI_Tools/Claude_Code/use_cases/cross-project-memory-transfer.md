Apply lessons and conventions from one project to bootstrap another.

## Prompt

```
Read CLAUDE.md from [PROJECT A path]. Extract patterns and conventions that would apply to [PROJECT B]. Then read PROJECT B structure and propose which patterns to adopt. Create or update PROJECT B CLAUDE.md accordingly.
```

## Usage Notes

- Replace `[PROJECT A path]` and `[PROJECT B]` with the relevant paths
- Great for spinning up projects that share a tech stack or team conventions
- Patterns are proposed, not blindly copied — agent filters for relevance
- Speeds up bootstrapping new repos in an existing ecosystem
