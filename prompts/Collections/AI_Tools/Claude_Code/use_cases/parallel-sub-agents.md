Fan out work across concurrent agents for faster execution.

## Prompt

```
Use the Task tool to run these sub-agents IN PARALLEL (launch all before awaiting):
- Agent A: [TASK A]
- Agent B: [TASK B]
- Agent C: [TASK C]

Collect all results and synthesize into a unified output.
```

## Usage Notes

- Replace `[TASK A/B/C]` with independent, non-dependent tasks
- All agents are launched before any results are awaited
- Best for tasks that do not depend on each other's output
- Synthesis step at the end combines all results
