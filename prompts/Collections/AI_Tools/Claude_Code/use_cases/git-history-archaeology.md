Trace git history to understand why code is written the way it is.

## Prompt

```
I want to understand why [FILE or FUNCTION] was written this way. Use git log to trace its history. Read commit messages and associated changes. Summarize the evolution and the reasoning behind current implementation decisions.
```

## Usage Notes

- Replace `[FILE or FUNCTION]` with what you are investigating
- Reveals the why behind code, not just the what
- Useful before refactoring — prevents undoing intentional decisions
- Also surfaces when a decision is old enough to be safely revisited
