Fully orient before starting work by reading all project memory and structure.

## Prompt

```
Before touching any code:
1) Read CLAUDE.md thoroughly
2) Read the README
3) List the top-level structure
4) Read the main entry point

Summarize your understanding of the project in 5 bullet points, then ask if your understanding is correct before proceeding.
```

## Usage Notes

- Use at the start of any new session in an established project
- The confirmation step catches misunderstandings before they cause problems
- Especially important when resuming work after a gap
- Can be combined with the Bootstrap prompt to create CLAUDE.md first
