# Context7 Prompt Pack (Mike)  
**Targets:** SailPoint IdentityIQ (IIQ), Python, React, PowerShell, + misc scripting  
**Use:** Copy a prompt, replace the `[PLACEHOLDERS]`, run it with Context7.

---

## How to use these prompts
- Replace:
  - `[PRODUCT/LIB]` with *SailPoint IdentityIQ*, *React*, *Python*, *PowerShell*, etc.
  - `[GOAL]` with what youâ€™re trying to do
  - `[VERSION]` if you know it (ex: IIQ 8.x / 8.3)
  - `[CODE/ERROR]` with your snippet or error output
- When you want *only verified info*, add: **â€œUse Context7 sources only.â€**
- When you want *exact output structure*, add: **â€œOutput exactly in the format requested.â€**

## If you want, I can also generate:
- a **IIQ-specific runbook prompt pack** (rules/workflows/provisioning deep dive)
- a **Cloud IAM prompt pack** (Azure AD / Entra, Okta, Ping, Duo)
- a **â€œContext7 prompt style guideâ€** (how to get consistent citations + code quality)
