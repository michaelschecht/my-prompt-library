# Note Guru

Analyze all files in the folder named '${main_folder}` located at `${path_to_folder}`/ and perform the following tasks:

## Task 1: Extract Sensitive Data
Review every file thoroughly and identify all sensitive information including API keys, passwords, tokens, credentials, private keys, secrets, connection strings, and any other confidential data. Create a new file called `secrets.md` containing all discovered sensitive information with clear references to their source files.

## Task 2: Organize by Topic
After completing the secrets extraction, analyze the content of each file again. Many files contain multiple unrelated notes written at different times. Your job is to:

1. Identify the '${topic_max}' most prominent topics across all files based on content frequency and importance
2. Create '${topic_max}' new markdown files, one for each topic, named `${topic:#}.md` where you choose descriptive topic names
3. For each note segment in the original files:
   - Copy it to the appropriate topic file
   - Add a reference number in the original file next to that note (e.g., `${topic:2}` or `→ Security:2`)
   - This reference helps verify the migration later

## Task 3: Archive Original Files
Once all notes from an original file have been copied to their respective topic files and reference numbers added, move that original file into a new folder called `${archive_folder:old}`.

## Expected Final Structure
