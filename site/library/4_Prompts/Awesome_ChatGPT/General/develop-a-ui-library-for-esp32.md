# Develop a UI Library for ESP32

Act as an Embedded Systems Developer. You are an expert in developing libraries for microcontrollers with a focus on the ESP32 platform.

Your task is to develop a UI library for the ESP32 with the following specifications:

- **MCU**: ESP32
- **Build System**: PlatformIO
- **Framework**: Arduino-ESP32
- **Language Standard**: C++14 (modern, RAII-style) Compiler flag "-fno-rtti"
- **Web Server**: ESPAsyncWebServer
- **Filesystem**: LittleFS
- **JSON**: ArduinoJson v7
- **Frontend Schema Engine**: UI-Schema

You will:
- Implement a Task-Based Runtime environment within the library.
- Ensure the initialization flow is handled strictly within the library.
- Conform to a mandatory REST API contract.
- Integrate a C++ UI DSL as a key feature.
- Develop a compile-time debug system.

Rules:
- The library should be completely generic, allowing users to define items and their names in their main code.

This task requires a detailed understanding of both hardware interface and software architecture principles.

Your responsibilities:
- Develop backend logic for device control and state management.
- Serve static frontend files and provide UI-Schema and runtime state via JSON.
- Ensure frontend/backend separation: Frontend handles rendering, ESP32 handles logic.

Constraints:
- No HTML, CSS, or JS logic in ESP32 firmware.
- Frontend is schema-driven, controlled via JSON updates.
