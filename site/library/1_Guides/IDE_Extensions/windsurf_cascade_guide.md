### First Launch

1. Install Windsurf IDE
2. Open Cascade panel: `Cmd+L` (macOS) or `Ctrl+L` (Windows/Linux)
3. Sign in with your account
4. Select preferred AI model

---

## 3. Cascade Modes

### Code Mode (Default)
Enables Cascade to create, modify, and refactor code across multiple files.

**Use for:**
- Writing new features
- Refactoring codebases
- Fixing bugs across files
- Implementing multi-file changes

**Activate:** Open Cascade with `Cmd+L` / `Ctrl+L`

### Chat Mode
Optimized for questions about codebase or general coding principles.

**Use for:**
- Understanding existing code
- Asking "how does X work?"
- Learning about patterns in the codebase
- Getting explanations without modifications

**Activate:** Switch mode in Cascade panel or use `@docs` for documentation queries

---

## 4. Core Features

### Persistent Agent

Cascade maintains a mental model of your project, tracking:
- **Project structure:** File organization, dependencies
- **Codebase context:** Functions, classes, patterns
- **Middleware & stack:** Frameworks, libraries, DB models
- **User actions:** Edits, commands, conversation history
- **Terminal output:** Build errors, test results

### Real-Time Awareness

Cascade infers intent by tracking:
- Manual code edits
- Terminal commands and output
- Conversation context
- Linter warnings/errors

### Multi-Step Execution

Cascade can autonomously:
- Create and edit multiple files
- Run terminal commands
- Iterate on its own output
- Execute plans across project

---

## 5. Tool Calling & Integration

### Built-in Capabilities

- **File operations:** Read, write, create, delete
- **Terminal execution:** Run builds, tests, scripts
- **Linter integration:** Real-time error awareness
- **Git operations:** Commit suggestions, branch awareness

### Model Context Protocol (MCP)

Connect Cascade to external tools and data sources:

**Supported integrations:**
- Databases (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.)
- APIs (REST, GraphQL endpoints)
- Documentation sites (via `@docs`)
- Custom tools and services

**Configuration:**
Add MCP servers in Windsurf settings to expand Cascade's capabilities.

---

## 6. AI Model Selection

### Available Models

**Premium Models (Complex Tasks):**
- GPT-4o (OpenAI)
- Claude Sonnet/Opus (Anthropic)
- Gemini Pro (Google)

**Fast Models (Quick Tasks):**
- GPT-4o mini
- Claude Haiku

### Bring Your Own Key (BYOK)

Configure your own API keys for supported models:

1. Open Windsurf Settings
2. Navigate to AI Models
3. Add your API key for preferred provider
4. Select model in Cascade panel

**BYOK Benefits:**
- No rate limits
- Direct billing
- Access to latest models

---

## 7. Context Management

### Project Indexing

Cascade automatically indexes:
- All source files in workspace
- Project dependencies
- Framework configurations
- Database schemas (if connected via MCP)

### Custom Context via `@docs`

Search and reference documentation:

```
@docs React hooks best practices
@docs Python async/await
@docs SQL joins
```

**Supported docs:**
- Windsurf help documentation
- Popular framework docs (React, Vue, Django, etc.)
- Custom documentation via URLs

### Custom Project Instructions

Create `.windsurf/instructions.md` in project root:

```markdown
# Project Instructions for Cascade

## Code Style
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Follow Airbnb ESLint config
- Prefer functional components

## Architecture
- Domain-driven design
- Repository pattern for data access
- Services for business logic

## Testing
- Write Jest tests for all new features
- Minimum 80% coverage
```

Cascade will follow these guidelines for all code generation.

---

## 8. Voice Input

Cascade supports voice-to-text for hands-free coding:

1. Click microphone icon in Cascade panel
2. Speak your request
3. Cascade transcribes and executes

**Use cases:**
- Accessibility
- Hands-free coding sessions
- Rapid iteration while reviewing code

---

## 9. Checkpoints & Iteration

### Checkpoints

Cascade creates automatic checkpoints during multi-step tasks:

**Benefits:**
- Rollback to previous state
- Review intermediate steps
- Branch from specific checkpoint

### Iterative Refinement

Cascade can iterate on its own output:

```
User: "Build a user authentication system"
Cascade: [Creates auth module]

User: "Add password reset functionality"
Cascade: [Builds on previous checkpoint]

User: "Add email verification"
Cascade: [Continues iterating]
```

---

## 10. Best Practices

### For Users

- **Be Specific:** Clear requests yield better results
  - ❌ "Fix the bug"
  - ✅ "Fix the null pointer exception in UserService.authenticate()"

- **Use Context:** Leverage `@docs` for framework-specific code
  - "Add a React component for user profile using @docs React hooks"

- **Iterate Incrementally:** Break large tasks into steps
  - "First, create the data model"
  - "Now add validation"
  - "Finally, add API endpoints"

- **Review Changes:** Always review generated code before committing

### For Projects

- **Set Up Project Instructions:** Create `.windsurf/instructions.md` early
- **Configure Linters:** Cascade respects linter rules
- **Use MCP:** Connect databases and APIs for richer context
- **Enable Git:** Cascade provides better suggestions with version control

### Security

- **Review Generated Code:** Check for security vulnerabilities
- **Limit API Access:** Use BYOK with scoped permissions
- **Validate External Calls:** Review MCP integrations before production

## 11. Example Workflows

### Feature Development

```
User: "Create a REST API for managing blog posts with CRUD operations"

Cascade:
1. Creates Post model with schema
2. Implements PostRepository
3. Builds PostService with business logic
4. Creates REST controllers
5. Adds validation middleware
6. Writes unit tests
7. Updates API documentation
```

### Debugging

```
User: "The authentication endpoint returns 500 errors. Check the logs."

Cascade:
1. Reads error logs from terminal
2. Identifies null pointer in token validation
3. Traces issue to missing environment variable
4. Suggests fix and implements it
5. Re-runs tests to verify
```

### Refactoring

```
User: "Refactor UserController to use dependency injection"

Cascade:
1. Analyzes current tight coupling
2. Creates service interfaces
3. Updates constructor for DI
4. Refactors all method calls
5. Updates tests with mocks
6. Validates with linter
```

## 12. Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue: "Cascade is not responding"**
- **Cause:** Model API rate limit or network issue
- **Solution:** Switch to different model or check internet connection

**Issue: "Cascade made incorrect changes"**
- **Cause:** Insufficient context or unclear request
- **Solution:** Provide more specific instructions, reference files explicitly

**Issue: "MCP server connection failed"**
- **Cause:** Invalid credentials or server down
- **Solution:** Verify MCP configuration in settings, check server status

**Issue: "Code doesn't follow project style"**
- **Cause:** Missing project instructions
- **Solution:** Create `.windsurf/instructions.md` with coding standards

---

## 13. Integration with Other Tools

### VS Code Extensions

Full compatibility with VS Code extensions:
