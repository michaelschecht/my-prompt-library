# Cline IDE Extension Guide

## Overview
This guide explores the Cline extension for VS Code, designed to integrate Claude and other LLMs directly into your development workflow.

## Agent Configuration
Cline requires an API key (e.g., Anthropic, OpenAI, or OpenRouter) to function. Set this up in the extension settings.

## System Prompt
Cline uses a predefined system prompt tailored for software engineering tasks, emphasizing reading files, executing commands, and writing code.

## Workflow
1. Open the Cline sidebar in VS Code.
2. Describe your task or issue.
3. Review Cline's proposed plan and file modifications.
4. Approve the changes.

## Example Interactions
- "Refactor `utils.py` to use Python 3.10 type hinting."
- "Write unit tests for the `calculate_total` function in `cart.ts`."
- "Explain how the routing works in this Next.js project."

## Best Practices
- Provide clear, specific instructions.
- Review proposed changes carefully before applying them.
- Use `.clinerules` to set project-specific guidelines.

## Customization Options
- Select different LLM providers and models.
- Customize the auto-approval settings for specific actions (e.g., read-only commands).

## Troubleshooting
- If Cline fails to modify a file, ensure it has the correct permissions.
- For context window errors, try closing irrelevant files or using a model with a larger context window.

## Integration
Seamlessly integrates with the VS Code workspace, terminal, and file system.
