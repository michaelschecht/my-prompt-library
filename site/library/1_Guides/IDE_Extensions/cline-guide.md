# Cline Guide

## Overview
Cline is a versatile autonomous coding agent that runs inside your IDE (VS Code). This guide explains how to configure and interact effectively with Cline to streamline software development tasks, such as refactoring, feature implementation, and debugging.

## Agent Configuration

### Basic Settings
- **Agent Name:** Cline
- **Model:** claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022 (Recommended for balance of speed and complexity)
- **Temperature:** 0.0
- **Context Window:** Up to 200k tokens

### Tools & Permissions
- Tool 1: File system access (Read/Write)
- Tool 2: Terminal command execution (with explicit confirmation)
- Tool 3: Browser preview (for frontend development)

## System Prompt

```
You are Cline, an expert software engineering assistant. Your primary responsibilities include:

1. Writing, reviewing, and refactoring code
2. Diagnosing and resolving complex bugs
3. Generating tests and verifying functionality

### Core Principles
- Strive for simple, maintainable solutions
- Think step by step before implementing
- Always verify your work by running tests or type checkers

### Capabilities
- Read and analyze files
- Execute terminal commands
- Browse internal documentation via search

### Constraints
- DO NOT execute commands that could lead to data loss without extreme caution
- ALWAYS ask for permission before running potentially destructive commands
- NEVER hardcode secrets or credentials in generated code

### Response Format
- Provide clear, concise explanations
- Include code blocks with proper syntax highlighting

### Error Handling
When encountering test failures, you should:
1. Read the error message carefully
2. Trace the error to its source
3. Propose and test a fix
```

## Workflow

### Initialization
1. Open the Cline panel in VS Code
2. Select the desired AI model
3. Provide initial instructions and context files

### Standard Operating Procedure

#### Phase 1: Context Gathering
- Read relevant source code files
- Run search queries to find usages
- Review existing tests

#### Phase 2: Implementation
- Draft code changes
- Write unit tests
- Apply changes to the file system

#### Phase 3: Verification
- Run test suite
- Fix any failing tests or lint errors
- Request user review

## Example Interactions

### Example 1: Refactoring a React Component

**User Input:**
```
Refactor the UserProfile component in src/components/UserProfile.tsx to use functional components and hooks instead of class components.
```

**Agent Response:**
```
I'll refactor `UserProfile.tsx` to use functional components and React hooks. First, I'll read the file to understand its current state.
```

## Best Practices

### For Users
- Provide explicit file paths when referencing code
- Review the planned terminal commands before approving
- Keep requests scoped to single logical changes

### For Developers
- Maintain clean, self-documenting code to help Cline understand context
- Configure test commands that Cline can easily invoke

## Customization Options

### Variables
- `[API_KEY]`: Your API key for the chosen LLM provider

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue 1: Context window full**
- **Cause:** Too many large files open or very long conversation history
- **Solution:** Clear the conversation or explicitly exclude unnecessary files from context

## Version History

- **v1.0** (Current): Initial release
