# Claude Code Tips & Tricks

Advanced tips for maximizing productivity with the Claude Code CLI.

## Overview
Claude Code is a command-line tool that allows Claude to read your codebase, write files, and execute commands. This guide provides advanced usage strategies.

## Agent Configuration
- **Authentication:** `claude login`.
- **Project Setup:** Run `claude` in your project root.

## System Prompt
You can guide Claude's behavior using project instructions in a `.claude.json` file or via global config.
```json
{
  "instructions": "You are assisting with a React/TypeScript project. Use functional components and hooks."
}
```

## Workflow
1. Open terminal in project root.
2. Run `claude`.
3. Describe the goal: "Refactor the database connection logic."

## Example Interactions
- **User:** "Find all instances where we use the deprecated API and update them."
- **Claude:** Uses ripgrep to find instances, modifies the files, and runs tests to verify the changes.

## Best Practices
- Give Claude explicit permission to run tests.
- Ask Claude to explain its plan before making large refactors.
- Use the `/compact` command to save context window.

## Customization Options
- Custom tools and scripts can be integrated.
- Ignore specific files/directories via `.claudeignore`.

## Troubleshooting
- **Context window full:** Use `/clear` or restart the session.
- **Command execution failures:** Ensure Claude has the necessary permissions.

## Integration
Integrates with standard bash/zsh tools like `grep`, `ls`, and your test runners.

## Version History
- v1.0.0: Initial release of tips.
