## Creating New Packs

Official skill packs are curated by the my-prompt-library team. To suggest a new pack:

1. Identify a common use case or domain
2. Select 5-15 related skills from the library
3. Create a pack manifest JSON file
4. Submit a pull request with:
   - Pack JSON file
   - Updated README listing
   - Rationale for the pack

**Pack Guidelines:**
- Clear, focused theme
- 5-15 skills (not too few, not overwhelming)
- Skills should work well together
- Cover a complete workflow or domain
- Useful for a specific audience

---

## Roadmap

**Current:** File-based official packs  
**Planned:**
- Web UI for browsing packs
- One-click pack installation
- Pack versioning and updates
- Pack analytics (installation counts, ratings)
- User-created packs (future phase)
