# Discord Automation System

Build an automated content distribution system for Discord channels with external source scraping and AI-powered content generation.

## Context
Multi-channel Discord automation that scrapes external sources (websites, GitHub repos, APIs), generates channel-specific summaries, and posts weekly updates.

## Requirements

### Channel Management
- Support multiple Discord channels (10-20+)
- Channel-specific content focus and tone
- Enable/disable channels individually
- Dry run mode for preview before posting

### Data Collection
- Web scraping (curl + HTML parsing)
- GitHub API integration (commits, releases, README)
- RSS/API feeds
- Content aggregation from multiple sources

### Content Generation
- AI-powered summarization
- Channel-specific tone adaptation
- 3-5 bullet point summaries
- Emoji formatting
- Source attribution

### Posting System
- Discord webhook/bot integration
- Rate limiting (avoid spam)
- Error handling and retry logic
- Comprehensive logging
- Preview/approval workflow

### Configuration
- JSON-based channel config
- JSON-based source config
- Cron scheduling (weekly/bi-weekly)
- Gradual rollout capability

## Architecture

```
External Sources → Scrapers → Data Store → AI Generator → Preview → Post to Discord
                                                              ↓
                                                         Human Review
```

## Key Files
- `channels.json` - Channel configurations
- `sources.json` - Data source definitions
- `scrape-web.sh` - Web scraper
- `scrape-github.sh` - GitHub scraper
- `generate-content.sh` - AI content generator
- `post-to-discord.sh` - Discord poster
- `weekly-update.sh` - Main orchestrator

## Example Use Cases
- Community newsletter automation
- Project update distribution
- Multi-channel content syndication
- Documentation update notifications

## Tech Stack
- Bash scripting
- curl for HTTP requests
- jq for JSON processing
- Discord API/webhooks
- AI API for content generation
- Cron for scheduling

## Safety Features
- Dry run mode (default)
- Preview generation
- Human approval step
