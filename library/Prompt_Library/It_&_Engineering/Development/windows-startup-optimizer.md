# Windows Startup Optimizer

## Purpose
Create a PowerShell script to dramatically reduce Windows boot time by managing startup programs, services, and scheduled tasks that run at system startup.

## Instructions

Generate a PowerShell script that optimizes Windows startup by:

### Startup Programs Management
1. **List all startup programs** from multiple locations:
   - Registry: `HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`
   - Registry: `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`
   - Startup folder: `%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup`
   - Task Scheduler startup tasks

2. **Categorize programs** by impact:
   - Critical (Required for system function)
   - Recommended (Important applications)
   - Optional (Can be disabled safely)
   - Bloatware (Should be disabled)

3. **Provide interactive selection** to disable unnecessary programs

### Service Startup Management
1. Identify services set to **"Automatic" startup**
2. Suggest candidates for **"Automatic (Delayed Start)"**
3. Recommend services that can be set to **"Manual"**
4. Flag services that can be **safely disabled**

### Scheduled Tasks Optimization
1. List all **scheduled tasks** that run at startup or logon
2. Identify tasks that can be:
   - Disabled completely
   - Delayed by 5-10 minutes
   - Changed to run on idle instead
3. Disable **Windows telemetry tasks**

### Boot Configuration Optimization
1. Adjust **boot timeout** settings
2. Disable **Fast Startup** if causing issues (optional)
3. Optimize **processor count** for boot
4. Configure **boot menu timeout**

### Disk I/O Optimization
1. **Defragment boot files** (HDD only)
2. Check and fix **boot sector issues**
3. Verify **disk health** status
4. Optimize **SSD TRIM** settings

## Output Format

```powershell
# ============================================
# Windows Startup Optimizer
# Created: [Date]
# Version: 1.0
# Requires: Administrator privileges
# ============================================

#Requires -RunAsAdministrator

# Measure current boot time
$bootTime = (Get-CimInstance -ClassName Win32_OperatingSystem).LastBootUpTime
$currentBootDuration = (Get-Date) - $bootTime
Write-Host "Current boot time: $($currentBootDuration.TotalSeconds) seconds" -ForegroundColor Cyan

# Create backup of current startup configuration
$backupPath = "$env:USERPROFILE\Desktop\startup-backup-$(Get-Date -Format 'yyyyMMdd-HHmmss').json"

# [Startup program analysis function]
function Get-StartupPrograms {
    # Registry locations
    $runKeys = @(
        "HKLM:\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run",
        "HKCU:\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run"
    )
    
    # [Implementation...]
}

# [Service optimization function]
function Optimize-StartupServices {
    # Get all automatic services
    $autoServices = Get-Service | Where-Object {$_.StartType -eq "Automatic"}
    
    # [Implementation...]
}

# [Task scheduler optimization]
function Optimize-ScheduledTasks {
    Get-ScheduledTask | Where-Object {
        $_.Settings.Enabled -eq $true -and 
        $_.Triggers.CimClass.CimClassName -match "MSFT_TaskBootTrigger|MSFT_TaskLogonTrigger"
    }
    
    # [Implementation...]
}

# Main execution

Write-Host "`nOptimization complete! Please restart your computer." -ForegroundColor Green

```

## Example Use Case

**Scenario**: Windows 11 PC takes 2-3 minutes to fully boot and become responsive.

**Script Actions**:
1. Measures current boot time: 2min 45sec
2. Finds 25 startup programs (18 unnecessary)
3. Identifies 12 services that can be delayed
4. Disables 8 telemetry scheduled tasks
5. Creates backup before changes

**Interactive Selections**:
```
Found the following startup programs:

CRITICAL:
  [X] Windows Security (Required)
  [X] Audio Service (Required)

RECOMMENDED:
  [?] Microsoft OneDrive
  [?] Google Chrome

OPTIONAL:
  [ ] Adobe Creative Cloud
  [ ] Spotify
  [ ] Discord

BLOATWARE:
  [ ] McAfee Auto-Updater
  [ ] HP Support Assistant
  [ ] Cortana

Select programs to disable (Space = toggle, Enter = confirm)
```

**Expected Outcome**:
- Boot time reduced to under 45 seconds
- Desktop becomes responsive immediately after login
- Memory usage at startup reduced by 30-40%
- Fewer background processes consuming resources

## Important Notes

- **Create backup** of all startup configurations before changes
- Script should be **reversible** (ability to restore from backup)
- Provide **detailed explanations** for each recommended change
- Include **warnings** for potentially risky changes
- Test on **non-critical system** first
- Consider **system type** (laptop vs desktop, SSD vs HDD)

## Advanced Features

1. **Boot time benchmarking** before and after optimization
2. **Startup impact scoring** for each program (Low/Medium/High)
3. **Automatic detection** of common bloatware by name patterns
4. **Export/import** optimization profiles
5. **Scheduled re-optimization** (monthly maintenance)
6. **Graphical comparison** of startup programs (before/after)
7. **Integration with Windows Event Log** to track boot times
8. **Recommendations based on hardware** (SSD vs HDD specific optimizations)
9. **Safe mode** that only disables obvious bloatware
10. **Aggressive mode** for maximum boot time reduction

## Safety Checklist

Before running the script:
- [ ] System restore point created
- [ ] Current configuration backed up
- [ ] Critical applications identified
- [ ] Anti-virus exclusions configured (if needed)
- [ ] User has reviewed what will be changed
- [ ] Rollback procedure documented
