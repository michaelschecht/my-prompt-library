# n8n Workflow Automation MCP Server Prompt Library

## 1. Create Simple Workflow
```
Create a new n8n workflow named "GitHub to Slack Notifier" with two nodes:
1. GitHub Trigger node listening for new issues
2. Slack node that posts a message to #dev-updates channel

Activate the workflow when done.
```

## 2. List Workflows
```
Show me all my n8n workflows, including their names, active/inactive status, and last execution time. Highlight any workflows that failed in the last 24 hours.
```

## 3. Execute Workflow
```
Manually execute the workflow named "Daily Report Generator". Wait for completion and show me the execution results, including any errors or output data.
```

## 4. Activate/Deactivate Workflow
```
Deactivate the workflow "Email Newsletter Sender" temporarily while I update the email template. I'll reactivate it later today.
```

## 5. Get Workflow Execution History
```
Retrieve the last 20 executions of the workflow "Customer Data Sync". For each execution, show me the status (success/error), start time, duration, and if it errored, show the error message.
```

## 6. Create Webhook Workflow
```
Create a workflow named "Form Submission Handler" that:
1. Starts with a Webhook node (POST endpoint)

3. If validation passes, send the data to a Google Sheet node
4. Send a confirmation email using Gmail node
5. Return a success response to the webhook caller

Provide me with the webhook URL once created.
```

## 7. Update Workflow Node
```
In the workflow "Data Pipeline", find the HTTP Request node and update its URL from "https://api-old.example.com/data" to "https://api-new.example.com/v2/data". Also add a header "API-Version: 2.0".
```

## 8. Clone Workflow
```
Create a copy of the workflow "Production Data Sync" and name it "Staging Data Sync". Update the database connection node in the cloned workflow to point to the staging database instead of production.
```
