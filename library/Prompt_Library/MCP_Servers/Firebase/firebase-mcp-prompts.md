# Firebase MCP Server Prompt Library

## 1. Add Document to Firestore
```
Add a new document to the "users" collection in Firestore with the following data:
- email: "john.doe@example.com"
- displayName: "John Doe"
- createdAt: server timestamp
- isActive: true
- preferences: { theme: "dark", notifications: true }

Return the auto-generated document ID.
```

## 2. Query Firestore Collection
```
Query the "posts" collection where:
- status equals "published"
- publishedAt is within the last 7 days
- Order by publishedAt descending
- Limit to 20 results

Return document IDs with their data (title, author, publishedAt, views).
```

## 3. Update Firestore Document
```
Update the document "users/user123" in Firestore to:
- Set lastLogin to current server timestamp
- Increment loginCount by 1
- Update status.online to true

Use a transaction to ensure atomic updates and return the updated document.
```

## 4. Delete Firestore Document
```
Delete the document at path "posts/post456" from Firestore. Also delete any subcollections (comments, likes) associated with this post. Confirm deletion and return number of documents deleted.
```

## 5. Batch Write Operations
```
Perform a batch write to create multiple documents atomically:

1. Create 3 new user documents in "users" collection
2. Create a "groups/team-alpha" document
3. Add all 3 users to "groups/team-alpha/members" subcollection
4. Update "groups/team-alpha" with member count

Execute as single atomic batch operation and confirm all writes succeeded.
```

## 6. Firebase Auth - Create User
```
Create a new Firebase Authentication user with:
- Email: newuser@example.com
- Password: (auto-generate secure password)
- Display name: "New User"
- Email verified: false

Send verification email and create corresponding user profile in Firestore "users" collection with additional fields:
- role: "member"
- onboardingCompleted: false
- createdAt: server timestamp

Return the user UID and profile document reference.
```

## 7. Upload File to Cloud Storage
```
Upload the file "profile-photo.jpg" from local path to Firebase Cloud Storage at:
- Bucket: "user-uploads"
- Path: "profiles/user123/avatar.jpg"

Set metadata:
- contentType: "image/jpeg"
- customMetadata: { uploadedBy: "user123", purpose: "profile-photo" }

Make file publicly accessible and return the download URL.
```

## 8. Firestore Real-time Listener
```
Set up a real-time listener on the "messages" collection where:
- chatRoomId equals "room123"
- createdAt is after [current time]

When new messages arrive:
1. Log the message data
2. Check if message mentions current user
3. If mentioned, create notification in "notifications" collection
4. Return real-time message updates

Show me the first 5 messages received.
```

## 9. Cloud Function Trigger
```
Create and deploy a Cloud Function that triggers when a new document is created in "orders" collection:

Function logic:
1. Extract order details
2. Validate order data
3. Calculate total with tax
4. Send order confirmation email
5. Create entry in "orderHistory" collection
6. Update inventory for purchased items
7. If high-value order (>$1000), notify sales team

Deploy the function and test with a sample order document.
```

## 10. Complex: User Onboarding Flow
```
Implement complete user onboarding workflow in Firebase:

1. **Create Auth User**:
   - Email/password authentication
   - Send verification email
   
2. **Create User Profile** (Firestore "users/{uid}"):
   - username, email, displayName
   - createdAt: server timestamp
   - onboarding: { completed: false, step: 1 }
   - settings: { notifications: true, language: "en" }

3. **Initialize User Data**:
   - Create "users/{uid}/preferences" document with defaults
   - Create "users/{uid}/stats" document (posts: 0, followers: 0)
   - Create welcome notification in "notifications" collection

4. **Setup Cloud Storage**:
   - Create user-specific folder in storage
   - Upload default avatar image

5. **Welcome Email**:
   - Trigger Cloud Function to send welcome email
   - Include getting started guide

6. **Track Onboarding**:
   - Create document in "onboardingProgress/{uid}" with steps:
     * emailVerification: pending
     * profileSetup: incomplete
     * firstPost: incomplete
     * firstFollow: incomplete

7. **Setup User Roles**:
   - Add custom claims to auth token (role: "user")
   - Create entry in "roles" collection

Return complete user profile with all created documents and storage references.
```

## 11. Complex: E-Commerce Cart Management
```
Build a shopping cart system with Firebase:

1. **Create Cart Document** (Firestore "carts/{userId}"):
   - userId
   - items: [] (array of product objects)
   - subtotal: 0
   - tax: 0
   - total: 0
   - lastUpdated: server timestamp

2. **Add Item to Cart**:
   - Fetch product details from "products/{productId}"
   - Validate product availability and price
   - Add to cart.items array or update quantity if exists
   - Recalculate subtotal, tax (8.5%), total
   - Use transaction to ensure consistency

3. **Remove Item from Cart**:
   - Remove item from array
   - Recalculate totals
   - Update lastUpdated timestamp

4. **Checkout Process**:
   - Validate all cart items still available
   - Create "orders/{orderId}" document with:
     * userId, items, totals
     * status: "pending"
     * createdAt: server timestamp
   - Create payment intent (simulate with doc)
   - Decrement inventory for each product (transaction)

5. **Order Confirmation**:
   - Update order status to "confirmed"
   - Clear user's cart
   - Send confirmation email (Cloud Function)
   - Create order in "orderHistory/{userId}/orders"

6. **Error Handling**:
   - If inventory insufficient: rollback, notify user
   - If payment fails: cancel order, restore inventory
   - Log all errors to "errorLogs" collection

Simulate complete flow from cart creation to order confirmation.
```

## 12. Firestore Security Rules Testing
```
Test Firestore security rules for the "posts" collection:

Current rules should enforce:
1. Authenticated users can read all published posts
2. Users can only create posts with their own userId
3. Users can only update/delete their own posts
4. Admins can update/delete any post

Test scenarios:
- Unauthenticated read attempt (should fail for draft posts)
- User creates post with different userId (should fail)
- User updates own post (should succeed)
- User updates another user's post (should fail)
- Admin updates any post (should succeed)

Run all test cases and report pass/fail for each scenario.
```

## 13. Complex: Social Media Feed
```
Build a social media feed system:

1. **Create Post** (Firestore "posts/{postId}"):
   - authorId, content, mediaUrls[], hashtags[]

   - Use batch writes for efficiency

3. **Like Post**:
   - Add document to "posts/{postId}/likes/{userId}"
   - Increment "posts/{postId}" stats.likes
   - Create notification for post author
   - Use transaction for atomic update

4. **Add Comment**:
   - Create "posts/{postId}/comments/{commentId}" with:
     * userId, text, createdAt
   - Increment post stats.comments
   - Notify post author (if not self)
   - Notify mentioned users (@username)

5. **Get User Feed**:
   - Query "feeds/{userId}/posts" ordered by createdAt desc
   - Limit to 20 posts
   - For each post, fetch:
     * Author details from "users"
     * Like status for current user
     * Comment count
   - Return formatted feed data

6. **Trending Posts**:
   - Query posts from last 24 hours
   - Calculate engagement score (likes * 2 + comments * 3)
   - Return top 10 trending posts

Implement and test feed creation, posting, and retrieval for 3 users.
```

   - Categorize: safe (80-100), review (40-79), unsafe (0-39)

4. **Workflow**:
   - Safe content:
     * Auto-publish to "posts" collection
     * Delete from pending
     * Notify user of publication
   
   - Needs review:
     * Move to "moderationQueue/{contentId}"
     * Assign to moderator
     * Create notification for mod team
   
   - Unsafe content:
     * Move to "blockedContent/{contentId}"
     * Notify user of rejection
     * Log reason in "moderationLogs"

5. **Moderator Actions**:
   - Approve: publish to posts
