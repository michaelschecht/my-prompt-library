# Cursor IDE Setup Guide

A comprehensive guide for configuring and utilizing Cursor IDE for AI-assisted development.

## Overview
Cursor is an AI-first IDE built on top of VS Code. This guide covers how to set up Cursor optimally for a productive development workflow, including system prompts and AI integrations.

## Agent Configuration
- **Model Recommendation:** Claude 3.5 Sonnet for reasoning, GPT-4o for quick edits.
- **Context Length:** Configure workspace context to include relevant directories.
- **Privacy Mode:** Enable Local mode if working on proprietary code.

## System Prompt
Include this in Cursor's `.cursorrules` file:
```
You are an expert software engineer. Always write clean, maintainable, and well-tested code. Follow standard formatting rules and write informative commit messages.
```

## Workflow
1. Use `Cmd+K` for inline code generation.
2. Use `Cmd+L` for chat-based assistance.
3. Reference external documentation using `@Docs`.

## Example Interactions
- **User:** `Cmd+K` -> "Extract this function into a separate utility class."
- **Cursor:** Automatically creates the utility class, imports it, and updates the references.

## Best Practices
- Always review AI-generated code before accepting.
- Provide clear and specific context using `@` mentions.
- Keep `.cursorrules` updated with project-specific guidelines.

## Customization Options
- Custom keybindings for AI features.
- Model selection per request.
- Integration with external knowledge bases.

## Troubleshooting
- **AI not understanding context:** Ensure relevant files are open or referenced via `@Files`.
- **Slow responses:** Check internet connection or switch to a faster model like Haiku.

## Integration
Cursor seamlessly integrates with all VS Code extensions. Ensure formatting and linting extensions are configured correctly.
