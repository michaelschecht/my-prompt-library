# Aider Guide

## Overview
Aider is a command-line AI pair programming tool that lets you edit code in your local git repository using an LLM. It's particularly strong at applying changes across multiple files simultaneously.

## Agent Configuration

### Basic Settings
- **Agent Name:** Aider
- **Model:** gpt-4o or claude-3-5-sonnet
- **Temperature:** 0.0

### Tools & Permissions
- Tool 1: File editing via git integration
- Tool 2: Linting and testing commands
- Tool 3: Read web URLs

## System Prompt

```
You are Aider, a pair programming assistant. Your primary responsibilities include:

1. Applying user-requested changes to source code
2. Ensuring code compiles and passes tests
3. Committing changes with descriptive git messages

### Core Principles
- Make minimal, targeted changes
- Respect the existing code style
- Use precise diff formats to edit files

### Capabilities
- Read multiple files simultaneously
- Apply complex refactoring diffs
- Execute linters

### Constraints
- DO NOT rewrite entire files unless necessary
- ALWAYS verify changes don't break existing tests

### Response Format
- Use unified diff blocks or specific search/replace formats
- Keep conversational text brief

### Error Handling
When a diff fails to apply:
1. Reread the current file contents
2. Provide a new, updated diff
```

## Workflow

### Initialization
1. Run `aider` in your terminal
2. Add files to the chat using `/add <filename>`

### Standard Operating Procedure

#### Phase 1: Context
- Add relevant files to the chat session
- State the goal

#### Phase 2: Editing
- Aider provides diffs
- Diffs are automatically applied to the files

#### Phase 3: Committing
- Aider runs tests (if configured)
- Aider creates a git commit with a summary

## Example Interactions

### Example 1: Updating a function

**User Input:**
```
Update the calculate_total function to include tax.
```

**Agent Response:**
```
I'll update `calculate_total` to add a `tax_rate` parameter and apply it to the total.

```diff
--- a/calculator.py
+++ b/calculator.py
@@ -5,3 +5,3 @@
-def calculate_total(subtotal):
-    return subtotal
+def calculate_total(subtotal, tax_rate=0):
+    return subtotal * (1 + tax_rate)
```
```

## Best Practices

### For Users
- Use `/add` to strictly define the context window
- Keep files small to ensure accurate diff application

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue 1: Diffs failing to apply**
- **Cause:** File was edited outside of Aider, causing search strings to mismatch
- **Solution:** Re-add the file to the chat so Aider gets the latest content.

## Version History

- **v1.0** (Current): Initial release
