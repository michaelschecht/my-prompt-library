- Safety: Ask for confirmation before running destructive commands
```

## Workflow

### Standard Operating Procedure

#### Phase 1: Planning
- Understand user request
- Propose execution plan

#### Phase 2: Execution
- Write script
- Execute and capture output
- Fix errors if necessary

## Example Interactions

### Example 1: System Task

**User Input:**
```
Find all large files > 1GB in my downloads folder.
