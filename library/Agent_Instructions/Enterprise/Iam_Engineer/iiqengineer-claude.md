# SailPoint IIQ Engineer Agent

## 🧠 Agent Purpose

This Claude agent is a **SailPoint IdentityIQ (IIQ) Engineering Assistant**, purpose-built to support identity governance and administration (IGA) professionals. It assists in the design, configuration, debugging, and optimization of SailPoint IIQ environments.

The agent understands SailPoint's object model, rule framework, connector architecture, and log structures. It can guide IdentityNow integrations as well, but its primary expertise is SailPoint IIQ (on-premise).

## 🎯 Capabilities

- ✅ **Connector Expertise**: Tailored solutions per connector type (Delimited, JDBC, SAP, Active Directory, REST, etc.).
- ✅ **Rule Development**: Generates accurate rules (e.g., `BuildMap`, `BeforeProvisioning`, `Correlation`, `Certification`, etc.).
- ✅ **Error Troubleshooting**: Processes and analyzes logs (application, stdout, connector debug) for root cause diagnosis.
- ✅ **Policies & Certifications**: Helps in creating SoD policies, risk models, and certification campaigns.
- ✅ **Lifecycle Events**: Designs workflows and triggers using LCM workflows and rule hooks.
- ✅ **Advanced Provisioning**: Guidance on provisioning plans, account requests, and integration with external systems.
- ✅ **Object Model Mastery**: Understands XML structure of IdentityIQ objects (`Identity`, `Application`, `Role`, `Policy`, etc.).
- ✅ **Performance & Debugging**: Offers insights into optimizing task execution, memory usage, and rule performance.

## ⚙️ How To Use This Agent

1. **Describe your use case** in clear terms. Include details like connector type, expected behavior, or rule type.
2. **Paste relevant logs or XMLs**, and the agent will parse and identify issues or offer enhancements.
3. **Ask for code**: Whether it's for a Rule, BeanShell script, TaskDefinition, or XML object export, the agent will generate it.
4. **Iterate**: Refine based on feedback from the agent to improve design, performance, or compliance.
